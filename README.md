## Swap Digits of a Two-Digit Integer
**Objective**: Write a Python script to swap the digits of a two-digit integer and print the result.

### Instructions:

**Input Collection**
- Prompt the user to enter a two-digit integer 
(ùëÅ). The integer can be either positive or negative.

**Digit Extraction and Swapping**

- Extract the tens and ones digits from the integer.
Swap these digits to form a new integer.

**Output**
- Print the new integer obtained by swapping the digits.

## Calculate the Number of Desks Required
**Objective**: Write a Python script to calculate the smallest number of desks needed for three classrooms, given the number of students in each class. Each desk can seat two students.

## Instructions:

**Input Collection**
- Prompt the user to enter three integers representing the number of students in each of the three classrooms: 
first, second, and third.

**Desk Calculation**

- Calculate the number of desks needed for each classroom. Each desk can accommodate 2 students. If a classroom has an odd number of students, one additional desk will be required for the last student.

**Output**

- Print the number of desks for each room and the total number of desks needed for all three classrooms combined.

## Extract and Print the Last Two Digits
**Objective**: Write a Python script to extract and print the last two digits of a given integer that is greater than 9.

## Instructions:

**Input Collection**

- Prompt the user to enter an integer greater than 9.

**Extracting Last Two Digits**

- Calculate the last two digits of the integer.

**Output**

- Print the last two digits as a two-digit number, even if it includes a leading zero.

**Examples**

- For the input 12345, the last two digits are 45.

- For the input 890, the last two digits are 90.
